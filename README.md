### 🚧 Projects

#### **🏎️ Drift Car Simulator**
I'm working on a challenging project that focuses on developing a realistic drift car simulation. The key difficulties lie in:
- **Precise Car Handling:** Implementing physics that allow for controlled drifts while maintaining responsiveness to user input. It involves fine-tuning friction, torque, and inertia to create a fun yet authentic drifting experience.
- **Drift Scoring System:** Creating an algorithm that accurately scores drifts based on angles, speed, and control. The system calculates performance dynamically while ensuring real-time feedback to the player.
- **Balancing Realism and Playability:** One of the toughest challenges is balancing accurate car physics without making the game overly difficult for players.

#### **🚦 AI Traffic Simulation**
This project involves creating an AI traffic system for a seamless open-world experience. Some of the complex aspects include:
- **Realistic AI Behavior:** Vehicles must follow traffic laws (e.g., stopping at lights, turning smoothly, avoiding collisions) while interacting with the player. Programming AI with such behavior requires intricate pathfinding algorithms and behavioral scripts.
- **Dynamic Traffic Flow:** Managing a variety of vehicle types and behaviors in real time without sacrificing performance is a major technical hurdle. The system needs to scale with increasing vehicle counts while maintaining a smooth gameplay experience.
- **Player Interaction:** AI cars are programmed to respond realistically when the player interacts with them, whether overtaking, cutting them off, or stopping suddenly in front of them.

#### **🛣️ Garage & Car Selection System**
In this project, I'm developing a sophisticated garage interface where players can browse, select, and customize cars. Some of the challenges include:
- **Smooth Car Transition:** The cars rotate and animate fluidly as the player browses, with custom logic to ensure cars spawn in the correct positions without visual glitches or delays.
- **Persistent Car Customization:** The system tracks player selections and customizations, ensuring the chosen car is reflected accurately when the game is played. This involves managing data persistence and loading times efficiently.
- **User Experience Optimization:** The interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, while the backend requires complex code to handle smooth transitions and conditional button displays (e.g., 'Play' only appears after a car is selected).
